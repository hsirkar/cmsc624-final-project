# Project structure

```
a2/              ->  Contains DAGER in both continuous and epoch-based scheduling variants
a2-final/        ->  Contains DAGER with a lock-free queue data structure
python_graph/    ->  Experimenting with DAGs in Python, not part of the final project
```

You can build and run `a2` or `a2-final` using the `cmake` directory within each of them.
