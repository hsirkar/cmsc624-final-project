# DAGER  

This repository contains the source code for **"From DAGs to Riches: Improving Transaction Throughput in a Deterministic System"**, our final project for **CMSC 624 (Database System Architecture and Implementation)**.  

DAGER is a novel algorithm designed to enhance transaction throughput in deterministic database systems. It utilizes directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for efficient transaction scheduling to improve transaction throughput. We implement DAGER within an in-memory key-value database (somewhat based on Assignment 2), simulating transactions under varying contention levels.
